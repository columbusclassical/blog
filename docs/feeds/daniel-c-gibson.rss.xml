&lt;p&gt;View children as &amp;ldquo;little angels?&amp;rdquo; Believe they are naturally good, needing only to be encouraged to grow? This is the false foundation of progressive education&amp;mdash;and it has profound implications for self-government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinkers like Rousseau, Froebel, and Dewey changed the course of education in the West, introducing terms like &amp;ldquo;kindergarten …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Daniel C.

That they view liberty as simply the state of being unfettered, so that all constraints must be abolished in order for man to be truly free? &lt;/p&gt;

Do those who talk about virtue seem like self-righteous prudes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impression is not entirely unearned. Often those who invoke the moral law take on an air of superiority rather than the introspection that self-awareness demands.

It starts with a recognition that equality &amp;ldquo;has no place in the world of the mind&amp;rdquo;. Yes, all men are created equal. But their ideas, philosophies, art, literature, governments, cultures are not. Sound pretentious, even anti-democratic? Consider the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
