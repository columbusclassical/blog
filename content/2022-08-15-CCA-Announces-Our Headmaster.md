CCA has tapped Daniel Gibson to serve as the founding headmaster of the school. Gibson, a graduate of Davidson College and Stanford Law School, was a partner at the Columbus law firm, Bricker & Eckler LLP, and left his position at the firm to take on the role of headmaster at CCA.

"I am so blessed to be part of the founding of Columbus Classical Academy," said Gibson. "I truly believe in the mission of a classical education to instill in students the knowledge and virtue upon which independent, responsible, and joyful lives are built and am grateful to the CCA board for entrusting me with the leadership of this good and necessary work."

Welcome, Mr. Gibson!
