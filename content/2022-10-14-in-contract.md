We're excited to announce that we are officially
In Contract!

CCA is currently in contract on a property in the Polaris area north of Columbus. The location is highly accessible, as travel time from virtually all of the major school districts in the Columbus area to the prospective site is under 25 minutes. However, pursuant to our confidentiality obligations under the pending purchase agreement, we are not permitted to disclose the specific property at this time.

Stay in touch for updates!
